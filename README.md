## Solutions for :christmas_tree: [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)

My second attempt to AoC. As previously in [Aoc2021](https://github.com/Oyoshi/advent-of-code-2021) all solutions are written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) :snake:. 
During this time I spent some time on learning Python concepts so I this trial should bo more mature and elegant than the previous one.

### Map

### Framework

I've created complete framework for running and benchmarking AoC 2022 solutions. All options are listed below:

```
options:
  -h, --help               show this help message and exit
  -d [1-25], --day [1-25]  day of AoC
  -p [1-2], --part [1-2]   part of the AoC day
  -b, --benchmark          compute benchmarks
```
Times for the benchmark will be measured for all solutions (single run, sorry). Input data can be found in `./inputs` folder :trollface:.

There are also Unit Tests which cover basic scenarios described in the task example part. Each commit triggers GA pipeline and run all UTs.
